This morning I was browsing the RSS feeds I subscribe too, one that caught my eye was [this new post by Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zaraz-supports-server-side-rendering-of-embeds).
I dont really use Twitter/X or Instagram but I just had to set it up and try it out to see how well it works.

## Instagram Test

## Update after posting
So it does not appear to be functional for me via Cloudflare Pages.  I'll keep poking and testing but for now it does not seem to be working right.
