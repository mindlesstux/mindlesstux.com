This morning I was browsing the RSS feeds I subscribe too, one that caught my eye was [this new post by Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zaraz-supports-server-side-rendering-of-embeds).
I dont really use Twitter/X or Instagram but I just had to set it up and try it out to see how well it works.
