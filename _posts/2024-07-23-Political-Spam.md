If I do interact with anyone asking whom I will be voting for...  The answer is [Cthulhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu) or [Flying Spaghetti Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster), depending on my hunger at the time of the interaction.  My personal belief is that politics and religion are yours to keep to yourself.  You can argue the points for each but you should not discount anyone for what they believe in.
