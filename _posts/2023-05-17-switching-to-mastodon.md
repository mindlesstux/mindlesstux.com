This will be a short post.  With [everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk) [that](https://ground.news/article/rss_3664_1668620446938_5?utm_medium=extension&utm_source=dw&utm_campaign=none) [has](https://ground.news/article/rss_3642_1680557922152_1) been going on with twitter, to me it just has become a toxic waste dump.  I am switching from even really looking at twitter as a viable news source option.  While I will maintain an account there, I will not use it for interactions if at all possible.

Instead I would urge people to move to Mastodon.  I would also suggest if you are able to, stand up their own instance.  This way people can do what they want and I can isolate the shit from actually reaching me and the bots that I will eventually stand up.  Perhaps that is a future posting of how to stand up a mastodon server.
