Sometime ago I wanted something that could be used to be liken a stream of my thoughts.  Later I saw a blog post on the [Matrix.org blog](https://matrix.org/blog/) talking about [Matrix Live Blog](https://live.hello-matrix.net/).  I saw it as the perfect thing to be the conduit for my random thoughts that have no purpose in being [toot](https://mastodon.mindlesstux.com/@mindlesstux)'s or blog posts.  I have been poking it for some time and still have tweaks I want to do to the code to fit what I want.  What makes it great is if you use a static site like I do, you only need javascript and a matrix server and chatroom. So nothing server side unless you count the Matrix chat server.  I have a chatroom and have a [link on the left](https://mindlesstux.com/liveblog/) that demos the live blog.  You can find the Matrix chat room that backs the page [here](https://matrix.to/#/#mtg-live-blog:mindlesstux.com).
