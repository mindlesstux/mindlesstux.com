What is [ADSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast)?  Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€“Broadcast.  In short is a means that aircraft announce where they are about every 2 seconds.  Some say it is a security risk, I say it is a good thing to have.  It can be used by other airplanes to know what planes are near them without having to rely on ATC.  Couple ADSB with a USB SDR stick and some software and I can provide a few sites what I can "see".

Here are a few sites and the associated stats/visualizers I supply my data to.

### [ADSB Exchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com/)
I am possibly reconsidering this option after the [drama](https://www.jetnet.com/news/jetnet-acquires-ads-b-exchange.html) [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADSB/comments/10l2euc/adsb_exchange_the_largest_unfiltered_network_has/) has unfolded
