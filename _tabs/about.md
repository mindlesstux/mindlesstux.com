# Who am I?
I am a random guy on the internet.  I play various games both single and mulitplayer, [see my steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mindlesstux/).  Long ago I worked with a group of guys working to maintain an online gaming group called "[Team Play First](https://teamplayfirst.com)".  Eventually that groups domain expired and we lost control of the site and the group kinda fizzled out.  I regained the domain after years of squaters and tryin to get the group back off the ground again. 

# What hobbies do I have?
I dabble in scripting of varioous things in various languages.  Some things to note a couple of plugins to [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) and provided an updated webgui to [dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090).  There are other things but those are the ones I am the most proud of.  I also run a few dedicated game servers which are mainly for my use but are open to the world.  I have a project to show the status of those servers right now and will be a blog post in the future once everything is working to my liking.  Last hobby I have is something I am working on, astrophotography.  Right now I have not gotten much past a few good shots of the moon but I hope to get better.

# How can I contact you?
You can reach out to me on various platforms.  You can find links to all the profiles on the various platforms/means at the bottom of the sidebar on the left.
